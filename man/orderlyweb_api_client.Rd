\usage{
orderlyweb_api_client(hostname, port, token, name = NULL, https = TRUE,
  prefix = NULL, api_version = 1, insecure = FALSE,
  verbose = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{hostname}{Fully qualified hostname for the OrderlyWeb instance}

\item{port}{Port to use}

\item{token}{Your application token for authentication}

\item{name}{A friendly name for the server (e.g, "production" or
"testing") which may be printed when using the remote, or when
authenticating.  If not provided then a name will be constructed
from \code{hostname}, \code{port} and (if provided)
\code{prefix}.}

\item{https}{Optional logical, indicating if this is an https
connection - this should be \code{TRUE} in all production
settings or credentials will be sent in the clear!}

\item{prefix}{A prefix, if your OrderlyWeb server is mounted at a
path within some larger website.}

\item{api_version}{The API version to request - this should be
left as 1.}

\item{insecure}{Avoid SSL certificate testing - this is completely
insecure (as bad as http) and exists only for testing.}

\item{verbose}{Be verbose in all http exchanges.  This will be
very noisy.}

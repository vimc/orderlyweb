> R client support for OrderlyWeb

The R package [`orderly`](https://github.com/vimc/orderly) has a [web interface called OrderlyWeb](https://github.com/vimc/orderly-web); this package provides support for `orderly` to interact with `OrderlyWeb` in order to download reports from a remote server and run them remotely

### Testing

For end-to-end testing, we need a copy of orderlyweb running.  This is most easily set up using the provided configuration ([`inst/config`](inst/config)) and running `orderly-web start inst/config` before running the tests.  The test suite will make changes within the configuration and will rely on the existance of particular reports.

To install `orderly-web` (the command line tool) use `pip3 install orderly-web`

A token is also needed to login with github; that can be found in the `vimc` vault as` secret/vimc-robot/vault-token` and should be available as the environment variable `ORDERLYWEB_TEST_TOKEN` (this is available on travis as an encrypted environment variable).

To stop the server, use `orderly-web stop inst/config --volumes --kill`
